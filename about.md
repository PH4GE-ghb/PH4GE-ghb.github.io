## What is the purpose of this site?

I created this place as a space in which I can manifest my thoughts, experiences and expressions. I'm not looking to profit, evoke, enlist, or pander to anyone at all. I just want to share some internal dialogues. If it resonates with you in any way by all means feel free to let me know.  


### Site not pretty. Why site not pretty?

It's pretty to me.

### Contact?

You can find a link to my Mastodon account under every article. I've tried the email thing in the past and it just led me down a world of spamful pain. So please reach out to me there for the meantime. I'm still considering alternatives for the future.
