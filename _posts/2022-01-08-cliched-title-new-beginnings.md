It truly sucks when you publicly commit yourself to something that rapidly becomes a chore. 

I learnt this the hard way whenever I would force myself to find a few hours over a long awaited weekend to piece together an article to stick on my site. I'm not speaking out of lethargy here, I used to work a 14 hour a day, 6 days a week pain in the ass job. Not fun. This made the whole blog thing a much bigger task than it had to be. 

I've created and erased many blogs I've made in the past. Some were a shot at amateur journalism, some were made up of instructional material, but most were just blogs.

Like many other noobers, I have tried my hand at the _"Let's get this sponsored"_ game. I've done the whole Medium.com lube yourself up and bend over thing. Writing boba tea articles about _"The 10 Best Daily Habits for Success"_ while posting autumn centric selfies to my Twatter account isn't what I'm about. No offense to those that _are_.

So I don't want this to become a blog. To that I say _"FAT SOUR BISCUITS"_. Indeed.

One of the things that I like the most about a personal online _data-web-cyber-space_ is creating the actual thing. I love the tinkering more than the commitment in the end. Considering this, it has dawned on me that it takes a certain type of person to truly commit to a blog. Someone who writes all day, understands public interests and has clear foresight to where they aim to push narratives. __That ain't me.__ 

I'm a hobby-holic person. I love taking up different projects and learning the ins and outs and generating focused work. I'm great at _starting_ projects... you see. My thinking is, whereas I may not always finish a project, I may as well document what I had here so that I can motivate myself or others to jump back in. 

This is another side as well, I'm really open to the idea of meeting new people through this site. Publishing material that will prompt others to reach out and want to share ideas would be a wonderful thing. _Another little goal._ Promises, promises though as this is quite a tall order, and as the name of the site indicates, I'm no tailor. 

I'm not gaining any money out of this, I'm not going to tell you how special and unique your arse is, I'm not looking for a sponsorship. I'm just one of those people from the internet of old, when we used to like creating content for the fun of it. Arrrrrggg.
