...by a vaccine. 

Yes, today I got my shot. _Shot for what?_ I don't here you ask. Well you know very well for what, the same thing everyone is getting it for lately. Today was my turn. I'd felt that I'd let the development of them go on for long enough that it was safe for me to _shift biscuit and risk it_.

It wasn't an easy or pleasant experience though. I did make a bit of a show of the whole thing...

I went in trembling slightly, for various reasons. At this point in time I'm recovering from a 6-month-long anxiety disorder that saw me locked in a house fearing anything beyond water and crumbs of food. I'd only recently started going outside again, and among the many things I feared, medicines and _effects on the body_ were waaaay up there. 

I got to the desk once my ticket was called and the nurse was real nice about the whole thing once she picked up that I was not very comfortable about anything. She answered all my questions and told me to head into the back of the testing room with her. She sat me on a stretcher and told me to take my time to come to terms with everything. 

See, what spooped me out the most was the _observational_ period you need to be in. This was an unwanted curveball and I kept thinking about how they had it for a reason. A reason that implied _"you might be the reason"_. In the end it turns out you only have to be there for 15 minutes most and that it was simply part of protocol. 

She stayed with me, asked me a few questions and checked her phone a bit. I think I heard her say it was her daughter's birthday. At one point she threw my feet up on the end of the stretcher to help me avoid any potential dizziness. Anyway, 8 minutes passed and I was on the phone to someone just to distract myself when she said I was good to go at this point. I checked that what I heard was correct because I clearly heard her say _"15"_ minutes earlier and she told me to stay longer if I wanted. I did. By the end of the day, I had a bit of pain in my arm and that was it aside from some dizziness, but that could be anything at this point. 

So yeah, I did it too. No political affiliation to any of the mentioned above, or this blog in general. Just documenting something _I_ did.
