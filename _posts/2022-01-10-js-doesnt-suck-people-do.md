So I woke up really early this morning as today was my first day at a new job. This is the first job I've had in a while that isn't solely about coding, it's more on the support side of things. Strange feeling, not coding and earning a salary. Getting a bit of the old _impostor syndrome_.

I decided to have a quick browse through the Fediverse while lying in bed trying to get my eyes to adjust, and I came across an article. The thing was about how some douche called Andrew Schwartz or Swartz or some shit, bandjaxed his own repos for Color.js and Faker.js to spee out American flags in the console. These packages were listed on NPM and were used in some pretty popular software by some pretty big names. The douche's reasoning for doing this was to protest big companies using his **FREE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE** for **FREE**...

I rarely use emojis but ðŸ˜‘ðŸ™„

This all comes not too long after the whole _log4j_ incident. Just another piece of bad news for js devs like myself. Things like this only paint a bad picture for NPM, Node and the whole FOSS community as a viable sustainable alternative to 100% proprietary software. Now all I see are people posting online about how "JS should be abandoned" and it's "on it's way out". Just not cool when something you have a right to love gets dragged through the mud publicly due to a lone douchebag. 

Oh, don't worry, I'll be making another post about how this was _"handled"_ by the powers that be. There's the real punchline.

I'm tired.

Not how I wanted to start/end my day.
