Hello again,

This post is intended to close a pretty obvious gap between now and my last post. _What may have caused this undeclared gap?_ I don't hear you say... Well, as I've made it known in one or two of my previous posts, I started a new job this month. So far, I've just come out of the _training_ period which means I'm being hit with longer hours, more tasks, etc... But what really caused this gap was fighting through _the Rona_. As I've also highlighted on here quite recently, someone I know had gotten it, and well, so did I. But I'm back, I got through it and so did they, thank god.

So the time is now, to continue plugging this site with more un/interesting content and anecdotes. I'll surely be having some this week because I've got some extra time off due to the fact that I worked a 12 hour, Sunday shift today. 

I also made some spur of the moment purchases today to get back into the swing of things when it comes to my long-time mechanical keyboard hobby. Yes, I'm sorry. This site will be seeing some mechanical keyboard posts...

Anyways, good to be back.
