On August 26th of 2023, the U.S. had a congressional hearing with David Fravor, Ryan Graves, and David Grusch. This hearing was referred to as the UAP Hearing, and my God was it a childhood dream come true.

Ever since I was a kid I've been a massive UFO dork. I used to say that my real parents were aliens and that they would come pick me up again one day. I've always been fascinated by the idea of there being another civilization out there. 

So much has changed around the UFO topic, even in my short lifetime. I remember as a kid I would always ask everyone at family reunions what they opinions were. I can remember the question back then being _"Do you believe in aliens?"_. People would laugh or tend to place it in the same categories as Bigfoot, ghosts, or the Loch Ness monster. But now, that question has changed to _"Do you believe they've visited us?"_. 

There no longer seems to be much of a doubt in the average person's mind that aliens must exist. It's even getting more and more common to find someone who says they've seen a UFO. Up until a few years ago, the only person I knew to have seen one was my Dad, and even then it was when he was a kid and he saw it with his father. 

Getting back to the hearing - why is it such a milestone? Whereas I won't get into the details of what was said, as you can find a mountain of info of that online, I will say it was enough to rekindle people's hopes that we may be on the precipice of a disclosure-level event. We witnessed congress hearing three people out on their experiences and knowledge of UFOs. UAPs if you're a new-age douche. 

A man claiming to have evidence of a crash retrieval program conducted for decades in secret by the U.S. has provided it to all relevant branches of the government, and done so through their own whistleblower program. I mean fucking hell this is amazing. 

Although no details of this evidence has been shared with the public yet (the reason being its still classified), it's the fact that this was done under oath that makes it interesting. These people will go to prison if what they say turns out to be a lie. Grusch also claims to have more than 40 firsthand witnesses that can be probed for details too. 

This is an advancement that only younger me could dream of coming true. 

Supposedly we can expect some more movement on this in September, when the congressional recesses end. I really hope we hear more soon, as that's what the word is online. The next few months look to be very interesting. 

If we have any form of confirmation that another species has visited this planet, this will be one of the biggest moments in human history. Giorgio Tsukalos is going to flip his fucking lid. I can only pray we get there. 

Thanks for reading.
