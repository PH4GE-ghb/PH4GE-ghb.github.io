It's been a while since I've touched base on a lot of different fronts. Front #1 being this blog obviously. There a reasons for that.

The last few months have seen my life change in many ways; from personal developments to professional, and maybe kind of spiritual ones too. In the past, whenever I've taken a notable gap between posting things to one of my blogs, I would have started off with some apologetic post, rambling on about how consistent I'm going to be or how sorry I am. This time, I'm coming back with fresh eyes. 

I've always written my blog posts with the perspective of how a reader might interpret, feel or see the contents. It's taken a few different personal hurdles for me to realize that I don't need to be writing content for anyone else. I started this little corner of the internet as a place for me to voice my internal dialogues, and maybe even get some words of advice from strangers. 

The reason anyone publishes anything to the internet is obviously to get some response out of it in one way or another. I'm not expecting anything back in this case. The internet is a massive ocean. I did have someone reach out to me on Mastodon at one point to tell me they resonated with my post about Impostor Syndrome, and that really made my day. So yeah, maybe something like that. 

I have a series of posts to get out of me. I need to manifest these things floating around my head, if anything, so that I can take a step back and look at them objectively. I'm in a place right now where I'm ready to take stock of where I am and what I've been through. Currently I'm on a break from work, so I want to take advantage and get these out of me. 

I can't afford therapy at the moment, so it's time to put the costs of this domain, and my time and effort put into creating all of this, to good use. 

Thanks for reading.
