![ergodox tenting kit](/img/egt.jpeg){:class="post-image"}

I'm an Ergodox EZ owner. Mine looks just like the image above, although this is a pic I pulled off the interweb.

I am testing leaving my Ergodox flat down on the table to see just how accurately I can type without the use of my tenting kit. 

The tenting kit is actually a nice bonus to have to be honest. It's been a while since I've used an Ergodox without one. It feels pretty interesting to say the least. 

I used to use my Ergodox infinity like this all the time due to the fact that it had no lighting at all and no tenting option, so it didn't really matter.

I'm going to fix that thing up tomorrow and give it a go again. I'll have to get used to flashing QMK firmware again, as Oryx has made modding my EZ all too "EZ". 

Anyways, this is just a throw-away post to test this configuration. I've actually just set my tenting back up again before writing this sentence... ðŸ˜¬

I'm also taking advantage to test out the O-ring dampeners that I stuck on earlier as well. They really do make typing a lot more comfortable, and I think I'm going to make them a requirement for all of my future builds. 

I'll make another post tomorrow to catch up on things.
